  Standard Schema</h1>

  A common interface for TypeScript validation libraries

<!-- start -->

Standard Schema is a common interface designed to be implemented by JavaScript and TypeScript schema libraries.

The goal is to make it easier for ecosystem tools to accept user-defined type validators, without needing to write custom logic or adapters for each supported library. And since Standard Schema is a specification, they can do so with no additional runtime dependencies. Integrate once, validate anywhere.

## Who designed it?

The spec was designed by the creators of Zod, Valibot, and ArkType. Recent versions of these libraries already implement the spec (see the [full list of compatible libraries](#what-schema-libraries-implement-the-spec) below).

## The interface

The specification consists of a single TypeScript interface `StandardSchemaV1` to be implemented by any schema library wishing to be spec-compliant.

This interface can be found below in its entirety. Libraries wishing to implement the spec can copy/paste the code block below into their codebase. It's also available at `@standard-schema/spec` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@standard-schema/spec) and [JSR](https://jsr.io/@standard-schema/spec). There will be zero changes without a major version bump.

```ts
/** The Standard Schema interface. */
export interface StandardSchemaV1<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {
  /** The Standard Schema properties. */
  readonly '~standard': StandardSchemaV1.Props<Input, Output>;
}

export declare namespace StandardSchemaV1 {
  /** The Standard Schema properties interface. */
  export interface Props<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {
    /** The version number of the standard. */
    readonly version: 1;
    /** The vendor name of the schema library. */
    readonly vendor: string;
    /** Validates unknown input values. */
    readonly validate: (
      value: unknown
    ) => Result<Output> | Promise<Result<Output>>;
    /** Inferred types associated with the schema. */
    readonly types?: Types<Input, Output> | undefined;
  }

  /** The result interface of the validate function. */
  export type Result<Output> = SuccessResult<Output> | FailureResult;

  /** The result interface if validation succeeds. */
  export interface SuccessResult<Output> {
    /** The typed output value. */
    readonly value: Output;
    /** The non-existent issues. */
    readonly issues?: undefined;
  }

  /** The result interface if validation fails. */
  export interface FailureResult {
    /** The issues of failed validation. */
    readonly issues: ReadonlyArray<Issue>;
  }

  /** The issue interface of the failure output. */
  export interface Issue {
    /** The error message of the issue. */
    readonly message: string;
    /** The path of the issue, if any. */
    readonly path?: ReadonlyArray<PropertyKey | PathSegment> | undefined;
  }

  /** The path segment interface of the issue. */
  export interface PathSegment {
    /** The key representing a path segment. */
    readonly key: PropertyKey;
  }

  /** The Standard Schema types interface. */
  export interface Types<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {
    /** The input type of the schema. */
    readonly input: Input;
    /** The output type of the schema. */
    readonly output: Output;
  }

  /** Infers the input type of a Standard Schema. */
  export type InferInput<Schema extends StandardSchemaV1> = NonNullable<
    Schema['~standard']['types']
  >['input'];

  /** Infers the output type of a Standard Schema. */
  export type InferOutput<Schema extends StandardSchemaV1> = NonNullable<
    Schema['~standard']['types']
  >['output'];
}
```

## Design goals

The specification meets a few primary design objectives:

- **Support runtime validation.** Given a Standard Schema compatible validator, you should be able to validate data with it (duh). Any validation errors should be presented in a standardized format.
- **Support static type inference.** For TypeScript libraries that do type inference, the specification provides a standard way for them to "advertise" their inferred type, so it can be extracted and used by external tools.
- **Minimal.** It should be easy for libraries to implement this spec in a few lines of code that call their existing functions/methods.
- **Avoid API conflicts.** The entire spec is tucked inside a single object property called `~standard`, which avoids potential naming conflicts with the API surface of existing libraries.
- **Do no harm to DX.** The `~standard` property is tilde-prefixed to [de-prioritize it in autocompletion](https://x.com/colinhacks/status/1816860780459073933). By contrast, an underscore-prefixed property would show up before properties/methods with alphanumeric names.

## What schema libraries implement the spec?

These are the libraries that have already implemented the Standard Schema interface. (If you maintain a library that implements the spec, [create a PR](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema/compare) to add yourself!)
